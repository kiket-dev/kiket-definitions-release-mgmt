# kiket-definitions-release-mgmt

Production release management workflow template for Kiket with multi-level approval chains, escalation policies, and rollback capabilities.

## Features

This template showcases Kiket's advanced workflow approval system:

### Multi-Level Approval Chains

The production deployment transition includes a comprehensive approval chain:

1. **Level 1 - QA Verification**: Any QA lead can approve (4h timeout)
2. **Level 2 - Technical Approval**: Parallel approval from Engineering AND SRE teams (8h timeout)
3. **Level 3 - Manager Sign-off**: Required for critical releases or breaking changes (24h timeout)
4. **Level 4 - Director Approval**: Required for major version releases (48h timeout)

### Escalation Policies

Automatic escalation when approvals timeout:

- **2 hours**: Reminder notification to current approvers
- **4 hours**: Escalate to engineering manager
- **8 hours**: Notify director
- **48 hours**: Auto-approve with audit trail

### Parallel Approval Groups

Level 2 demonstrates parallel approvals where both engineering AND SRE teams must sign off before proceeding.

### Conditional Approval Levels

Levels 3 and 4 are conditionally triggered based on:
- Priority (critical releases require manager approval)
- Labels (breaking-change label triggers manager approval)
- Release type (major versions require director approval)

## Workflow States

```
development → staging → pending_approval → production → completed
                ↓              ↓                ↓
             (rework)     (rejected)      → rollback → failed
```

- **Development**: Feature development in progress
- **Staging**: Deployed to staging environment for testing
- **Pending Approval**: Awaiting production approval chain
- **Production**: Deployed to production
- **Rollback**: Production rollback initiated
- **Completed**: Release successfully deployed and verified
- **Failed**: Release failed or rolled back

## Issue Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Release | Standard software release with version tag and changelog |
| Hotfix | Emergency fix for production issues |
| FeatureFlag | Feature flag rollout management |
| Postmortem | Post-incident analysis document |
| ChangeRequest | Infrastructure or configuration change |

## Automation Recipes

### Production Approval Escalation
Escalates production approvals blocking releases beyond the 4-hour SLA.

### Stale Release Follow-up
Notifies assignees when releases remain in development (7+ days) or staging (3+ days).

### Hotfix Fast Track
Expedites critical hotfixes by:
- Skipping manager/director approval levels
- Reducing approval timeouts to 1 hour
- Adding on-call SRE to approvers
- Triggering PagerDuty alerts

### Rollback Incident Management
Automatically triggered when a release enters rollback state:
- Creates incident in PagerDuty
- Notifies Slack incident response channel
- Creates postmortem issue
- Requires SRE confirmation to complete rollback

## Analytics

The `deployment_health` dashboard tracks:

- **Release Velocity**: Deployments to production over time
- **Approval Time**: Average time spent waiting for approvals by level
- **Rollback Rate**: Percentage of releases requiring rollback
- **Lead Time Distribution**: Time from development to production
- **Approval Bottlenecks**: Wait times by approver role

### Alerts

- High rollback rate (>10%)
- Stale pending approvals (>8 hours)
- Approval SLA breach (>24 hours)

## Installation

1. Install the template in your Kiket project:
   ```bash
   kiket definitions install release-mgmt
   ```

2. Configure roles in your project settings:
   - `qa_lead` - QA team leads
   - `engineering_lead` - Engineering team leads
   - `sre` - Site Reliability Engineers
   - `engineering_manager` - Engineering managers
   - `director` - Engineering directors
   - `sre_oncall` - On-call SRE rotation

3. Configure notification channels:
   - Slack: `#release-approvals`, `#incident-response`
   - PagerDuty integration for critical alerts
   - Email notifications for escalations

4. Customize approval timeouts and thresholds in the workflow YAML as needed.

## Best Practices

- **Start with shorter timeouts** for hotfixes and urgent releases
- **Use labels** to trigger conditional approval levels
- **Review rollback postmortems** to improve release quality
- **Monitor approval bottlenecks** to identify process improvements
- **Set up delegation** for approvers during vacation/OOO
